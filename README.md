I'm CapnBry, full name Cap'n Bry, or CapnBree or CapnBarry depending on your pronounciation. I created the [HeaterMeter wifi BBQ controller project](https://heatermeter.com) and am an [ExpressLRS](https://github.com/ExpressLRS/ExpressLRS/) developer.

* I like to make things
* I am tired of explaining code to people who I'll never hear from again
